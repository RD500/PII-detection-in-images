The project is about detecting personal identifiable information (PII) 
in the uploaded images using OCR for converting images to text and Azure text analytics for detecting PII. 
We have also implemented a window where user can enter his or her choice on which PII should be masked and not.
Additionally for masking the PII we have implemented image processing by creating black rectangular boxes.
